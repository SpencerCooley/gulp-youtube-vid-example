#basic gulp examples

There are a number of branches in this repository demonstrating different types of gulp tasks. 

###branches:
+ master - just a simple hello world task 
+ sass-example  - an example task that converts scss to css, also a gulp watch demo
+ js-example - some javascript task examples. minification, concatination, stuff like that. 


I did not include an example of how to push files to s3, but there is a cool plugin for that that.

I am using it in a project right now in my workflow on a salesforce project.
